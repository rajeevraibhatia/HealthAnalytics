# HealthAnalytics

The project takes Raw Data from iPhone and converts the datapoints like Step Count, Sleep, Flights Climbed to build a Health Analytics and Prediction System that can be useful to understand patterns. We have also collected user User Information for all our 25 User Base whose data we have have analysed in this Project.

This project will be extremely helpful to understand User Health Patterns and help users self-reflect their Health Metrics with respect to their friends and community

Libraries used:

Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Sklearn
Pyplot
CalMap

Results are available here:

Future Enhancements
In the future, we could create a HealthScore which can be calculated based on insights from our Clusters and then label our Ground Truth label. This will be very useful to use for a Classification algorithims which can then be used for Real-Time analysis of Health Index for users on a Daily Basis.

Through this project, we hope to use the insights to help users in self-reflection of their data and then improve their overall health.
